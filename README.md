There are three options available for implementing the logic:

1- Using simple conditionals
2- using table programming
3- using the chain of responsibility pattern

As always the simplest option wins. so, I used the first method because the project is small and the logic isn't very complicated. But for the bigger and more complex rules other options might be better. 

Reading cities' data from the CSV file which is also a simple and maintainable option.

I've also used a simplified clean architecture for the project.
